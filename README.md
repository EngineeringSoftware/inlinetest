# I-Test

## Introduction

This repo contains the code and data for producing the experiments in
[Inline Tests][paper-url].  In this work, we proposed a new type of
tests, inline tests, which reside below unit tests in the hierarchy of
test types.  Inline tests can be used to test the code on the
statement level. We implemented I-Test framework for developers to
write inline tests in Java and Python. I-Test framework has been
integrated with popular testing frameworks pytest and Junit. 

The code includes:
* I-Test framework for Python
* I-Test framework for Java
* scripts for collecting and filtering examples suitable for writing inline tests
* scripts for evaluating the performance of I-Test

The data includes:
* the 50 Python examples and 50 Java examples with our written inline tests
* results of performance evaluation (on our machine)
* the documents used in our user study
* anonymized results of our user study


**How to...**
* **install I-Test and the environment for replicating our study**: see detailed steps in [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md)
* **replicate our performance evaluation of I-Test**: see detailed steps in [REPLICATION.md](/REPLICATION.md)
* **replicate other parts of our paper, e.g., collecting examples and user study**: we already described the steps in the paper, and you may find the documents and intermediate files for those in this repository; see the remainder of this README for more details
